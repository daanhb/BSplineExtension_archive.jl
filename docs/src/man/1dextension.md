The package provides a fast solver for a B-spline extensions such as, e.g.,
```jldoctest 1dframe
julia> P1 = ExtensionFramePlatform(BSplinePlatform(),0.0..0.5)
ExtensionFramePlatform(BSplinePlatform{Float64,3}(), 0.0..0.5)
julia> P2 = ExtensionFramePlatform(EpsBSplinePlatform(),0.0..0.5)
ExtensionFramePlatform(EpsBSplinePlatform{Float64,3}(), 0.0..0.5)
julia> P3 = ExtensionFramePlatform(CDBSplinePlatform(),0.0..0.5)
ExtensionFramePlatform(CDBSplinePlatform{Float64,3}(), 0.0..0.5)
```

## The AZ algorithm
The AZ algorithm (reference needed) provides for a fast approximation algorithm
even though the system that needs to be solved is rectangular, and highly ill conditioned

The AZ algorithm consists of three steps for solving a system `Ax=b`
- Solve `(A-AZ'A)x1 = (I-AZ')b`
- `x2 = Z'(b-Ax1)`
- `x = x1 + x2`

Z can be any matrix, but the algorithm is most efficient if `A` and `Z'` can be applied fast, and
`A-AZ'A` is of low rank.

For the platforms above these operators are readily available using `AZ_A` and `AZ_Zt`:
```jldoctest 1dframe
julia> N = 200;


julia> AZ_A(P1,N)
Operator D * R[1:401 ‚Üí ùïÄ] * M

## Sparseness of `A` and `Z'`
The `FrameFun` package contains fast solvers for solving the low-rank system of
the first AZ step. However, it does not use the (œµ-)sparse (with sparse: a lot of zero elements)
structure of `A` and `Zt`
which is a consequence of the compact nature of a B-spline basis.
For all platforms `AZ_A` returns the same operator. As is seen above `A` is a banded matrix, hence sparse.
For `P1` is `Z'` is the product of a banded matrix and a circulant matrix.
The circulant matrix has exponentially decreasing elements in the first column, hence œµ-sparse.
Only for `P2` and `P3`, `Z'` is actually be sparse.

# BSplineExtensionSolver
The [`BSplineExtensionSolver`](@ref) of this package uses the compactness of the B-spline
basis and by consequence the sparseness of `A` and `Z'`.
First, the compactness of the B-spline basis introduces a lot of zero columns in `A-AZ'A`.
Therefore, the BSplineExtensionSolver removes the zero columns. It knows of the location of
the non zero columns by using [`nonzero_coefficients`](@ref).
Secondly, since also the dual dictionary is (œµ-)compactness (see [Basis platforms](@ref) for examples of these dual dictionaries),
`A-AZ'A` will contain some (œµ-)zero rows. These are also removed by the `BSplineExtensionSolver`, where `crop_tol` is a parameter that
indicates how large œµ should be. The resulting system is of size [`truncated_size`](@ref).

Below we illustrate how the `truncated_size` of a `BSplineExtensionSolver` changes for varying
platform, B-spline order (`m`), `crop_tol` and degrees of freedom (`N`).

## Column truncation
The column truncation of `A-AZ'A` depends on the order of the B-spline (and the domain) only.
This is seen in the figure below, which shows `truncated_size(S)[2]` with `S=BSplineExtensionSolver(A-A*Zt*A)`.

## Row truncation
The row truncation of `A-AZ'A` depends on all of the parameters.
This is seen in the figure below, which shows `truncated_size(S)[1]` with
`S=BSplineExtensionSolver(A-A*Zt*A;crop_tol=crop_tol)`
for `crop_tol` in (1e-16, 1e-10).

The truncated size reaches a limit for `N` growing large. This limit is much smaller using `CDBSplinePlatform`.
The `EpsBSplinePlatform` is a bit more robust  than the `BSplinePlatform` in generating a low truncated size
since it enforces the dual dictionary to be
compact, while the dual dictionaries of the latter are only œµ-compact.

# B-spline extension approximation
The [`BSplineExtensionSolver`](@ref) is just a means to an end. It is used in the
first step of the AZ algorithm. In this section we use the solver to approximate
the exponential function on the interval [0,0.5] using a B-spline basis of order
`m` on the interval [0,1]. First we show the convergence results, then the time complexity
of the approximation algorithm.

## Errors
In the figure below, which shows the uniform error of approximating a 1 dimensional analytic function (details are in the introduction of this section),
 we see that convergence is algebraic ($$\mathcal O(N^{-m})$$).
This is common behaviour for approximating with splines.

## Timings
For all platforms, the most costly part is the evaluating operator-vector multiply $$(A-AZ'A)x$$ since
solving the system is constant in `N` (it is $$\mathcal O(d^3)$$).
For the first platform the operator-vector multiply time complexity is $$\mathcal O(N\log N)$$. For the
last two the multiply time complexity is $$\mathcal O(N)$$. However, the construction complexity of `Z'` for the first two
platforms is also $$\mathcal O(N\log N)$$.  

The quasi-linear behaviour of the method is confirmed in the figure below that
show the timings for approximating a 1 dimensional analytic function
    (details are in the introduction of this section).
